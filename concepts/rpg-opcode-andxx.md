# ANDxx (And)

Free-Form Syntax: (not allowed - use the AND operator)

## Code

| Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Result Field | Indicators |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| ANDxx | Comparand | Comparand | |

This operation must immediately follow a ANDxx, DOUxx, DOWxx, IFxx, ORxx, or WHENxx operation. With ANDxx, you can specify a complex condition for the DOUxx, DOWxx, IFxx, and WHENxx operations. The ANDxx operation has higher precedence than the ORxx operation.

The control level entry (positions 7 and 8) can be blank or can contain an L1 through L9 indicator, an LR indicator, or an L0 entry to group the statement within the appropriate section of the program. The control level entry must be the same as the control level entry for the associated DOUxx, DOWxx, IFxx, or WHENxx operation. Conditioning indicator entries (positions 9 through 11) are not permitted.

Factor 1 and factor 2 must contain a literal, a named constant, a figurative constant, a table name, an array element, a data structure name, or a field name. Factor 1 and factor 2 must be of the same type. For example, a character field cannot be compared with a numeric. The comparison of factor 1 and factor 2 follows the same rules as those given for the compare operations. See "Compare Operations" on page 607.

## Example

```
 *..1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7...+....
 CL0N01Factor1+++++++Opcode(E)+Factor2+++++++Result++++++++Len++D+HiLoEq....
  *
  * If ACODE is equal to A and indicator 50 is on, the MOVE
  * and WRITE operations are processed.
 C     ACODE         IFEQ      'A'
 C     *IN50         ANDEQ     *ON
 C                   MOVE      'A'           ACREC
 C                   WRITE     RCRSN
  * If the previous conditions were not met but ACODE is equal
  * to A, indicator 50 is off, and ACREC is equal to D, the
  * following MOVE operation is processed.
 C                   ELSE
 C     ACODE         IFEQ      'A'
 C     *IN50         ANDEQ     *OFF
 C     ACREC         ANDEQ     'D'
 C                   MOVE      'A'           ACREC
 C                   ENDIF
 C                   ENDIF
