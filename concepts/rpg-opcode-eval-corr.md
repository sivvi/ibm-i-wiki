# EVAL-CORR (Assign Corresponding Subfields)

## Free-Form Syntax

```
EVAL-CORR{(HMR)} target = source;
```

## Code

| Factor 1 | Extended Factor 2 |
|----------|------------------|
| | target = source |

## Description

The EVAL-CORR operation assigns data and null-indicators from the corresponding subfields of the source data structure to the subfields of the target data structure. The subfields that are assigned are the subfields that have the same name and compatible data type in both data structures. For example, if data structure DS1 has character subfields A, B, and C, and data structure DS2 has character subfields B, C, and D, statement

```
EVAL-CORR DS1 = DS2
```

will assign data from subfields DS2.B and DS2.C to DS1.B and DS1.C. Null-capable subfields in the target data structure that are affected by the EVAL-CORR operation will also have their null-indicators set from the null-indicator from the source data structure's subfield, or to *OFF, if the source subfield is not null-capable.

If an operation code extender H is specified, the half-adjust function applies on all numeric assignments. Extenders for EVAL-CORR can be specified only in Free-form calculations.

If operation code extender M or R is specified, it applies to the arguments of any procedure call specified as part of the source or target expression. Extenders for EVAL-CORR can be specified only in Free-form calculations.

For information on how the CHARCOUNT mode affects EVAL-CORR, see "Assignment of data with different character sizes" on page 631.

The EVAL-CORR Summary section in the compiler listing can be used to determine:
- which subfields were selected to be affected by the EVAL-CORR operation
- for subfields not selected, the reason the subfield was not selected
- for subfields that are selected, any additional information about the subfields such as a difference in the dimension or null-capability of the subfields.

See the Rational Development Studio for i: ILE RPG Programmer's Guide for more information about the EVAL-CORR Summary section.

**Remember the following when using the EVAL-CORR operation:**

- Operation code EVAL-CORR may be coded either in free-form calculations or in fixed-form calculations. When coded in fixed-form calculations, the assignment expression is coded in the Extended Factor 2 entry, with the Factor 1 entry left blank.
- The source and target operands must both be data structure variables, including data structure subfields defined with LIKEDS or LIKEREC.
- The operands may be qualified or unqualified data structures. However, for the operation to be successful, at least one of the operands must be a qualified data structure; otherwise, it would not be possible for the two data structures to have any subfields with the same name.
- The subfields involved in the assignment are those that have the same name in both data structures and have data types that are compatible for assignment using EVAL.
- When comparing the subfield names to find corresponding subfieds, the names used are the internal program names; the internal program names may be different from the external names in the case of fields from externally-described files or data structures. For fields defined externally and renamed or prefixed, the name used is the name after applying the rename or prefix.
